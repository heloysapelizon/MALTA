This repository is meant for sharing my algorithms learned during my research mentorship at MALTA lab situated in PUCRS, focused on learning machine learning topics. I have developed a linear regression
algorithm, a multiple feature linear regression, as well as learned how to handle the Pytorch library.

The algorithms were developed in Python through Jupyter Notebooks and can be executed in any development environment with the necessary imports for Python.
